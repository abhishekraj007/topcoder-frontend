# Topcoder Pages deconstructed

Taking Topcoder Front Page as design inspiration and converting it into code to practice my Front-end development skill.

Find Demo [here](https://abhishekraj007.github.io/apps/topcoder)




##Note

ALL of the contents and design used during practice session is the property of topcoder. I don't claim to hold any of the contents/resources. I have used the contents just for the placeholder and design as an inspiration to practice my front-end development skill.
